# Valentine Link Sharer

This is a rather simple project I wanted to make for my bae :3. It consists of a valentine message maker as well as a means to view the aforementioned message.

## Structure

There are 3 main parts of this web app:

- Home Page (introduces the application with a small guide / help tips)
- Message Maker (uses 2 forms to create valentine messages which can be shared via urls with compressed data)
- Message Viewer (displays an encoded valentine message from a url)

### Message Maker

A valentine message will be split into 2 parts; an inital collection of text to display, and finally, the "yes or no" part. As such, 2 forms will be used.
